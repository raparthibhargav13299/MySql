Difference between DROP, DELETE, TRUNCATE
--------------------------------------------
-DROP: It will be used to delete the database completely along with the data inside it, and also the database
itself--> DATABASE, TABLE, COLUMN
-DELETE: It will delete the data from the database or table, but it won't delete the structure of database or table
        --Delete can be used along with condition WHERE clause: DML
-TRUNCATE: DDL: Unconditional


------CONSTRAINTS-------
-Primary Key
-Foreign Key
-Unique
-Composite Key

--Primary Key: Primary key is used to uniquely identify the rows in a table.
   --We can have only one primary key per table.
   --we can't have null values
   
--Unique Key: Unique is also used to uniquely identify the rows in table.
    --Unique key can have one NULL value
    --we can have more than one uniq keys in our table

---Composite Key:

-----Transaction: where two parties are invovled for sending or receiving the data or money
Google Pay: Aditya ---> Lohith
--Adithya sender: 10000 --->5000 10000-5000=5000
--Lohith receiver: 20000 <---5000 20000+5000=25000


    amazon: Laptop:
        --put in kart
        --you make the payment
        --seller will receive the money---did not receive
        --order details history in your account
        --he will deliver the product

"eitehr complete all the SQL statements or none of them"
statement-1
--done
statement-2
--done   ---> rollback st-2 to st-1
statement-3
--done
statement-4 ---> roollback st-4 to st-1
--did not receive
statement-5
statement-6
statement-7

ACID:
Atomicity: eitehr complete all the SQL statements or none
C: Consistency: after completing all the transactions then only it will make the changes in DB
I: Isolation: Lots of transaction are going on but without interference ---->10000-2500
D: Durability: after the all transactions, changes will pe permanent




In SQL by default: Every statement will be executed as single statement.
